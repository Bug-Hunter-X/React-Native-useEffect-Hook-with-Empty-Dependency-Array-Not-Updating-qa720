This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an empty dependency array (`[]`).  The effect runs only once after the initial render, which is usually the intended behavior. However, if the effect relies on values that might change outside of React's component lifecycle (e.g., native modules, timers, or external events), the effect won't re-run, leading to unexpected results.  For example, if the effect subscribes to a native module event, it will only receive the first event and miss subsequent updates.
